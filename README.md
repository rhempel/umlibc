# ummlibc

A bare-bones libc for memory constrained systems

This librbary is made up of source files from a few different
projects, see the individual files for specific licence
terms - the LICENSE at the root of this file covers the makefiles
that assemble the source into a library.

Note also that the makefiles assume that my multi-platform make
system is being used, this will be added in a separate repository later.
